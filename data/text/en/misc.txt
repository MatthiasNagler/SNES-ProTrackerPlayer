# textfile, utf-8 format.
#
# Here are some special chars so that your text editor knows what encoding to select: äöüß€
#
# File format:
# Comments are denoted by # as first character on a line 
# Textlines are denoted like so: identifier=textstring
# Identifiers may consist of Letters A-Z, a-z and number 0-9
# Anything not identified as comment line or new textstring is appended to last string
# Whitespace, linebreaks, tabs in front and after each textstring are stripped.
# Lines may be separated by Unix (\n) or Windows (\r\n) linebreaks
# Linebreaks in this file DO NOT translate to linebreaks in the in-game text. Use the <break> command for that
#
# Control codes are denoted by <command[, arg0, arg1, ... argn]>
# For a list of supported control codes, see documentation
